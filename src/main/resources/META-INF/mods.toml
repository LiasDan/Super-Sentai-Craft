Since 1975, The Super Sentai Series has captivated people across the world with it's stories, characters, and it's 'tokusatsu' production techniques. Now, nearly 50 years of Japanese cultural icons arrives in Minecraft!
Super Sentai Craft began as a small project in March 2019, and has since evolved into a spawling mod with hundreds of items, weapons, and forms with multiple developers on board.
